# Runtime, Viewer and configuration ownership

Paths are relative to the repository root.

## Inference algorithm versus executor

Read `manimux/runtime/inference.py` (`InferenceStrategy`,
`build_inference_strategy`) and the selected strategy, such as
`runtime/rtc/strategy.py`. A new inference algorithm controls when to submit,
sampling requirements, chunk preparation, commit settings and response feedback.
Use those hooks and their existing strategy factory; do not imply every factory
supports arbitrary plugins or add algorithm-specific branches to adapters.

`manimux/runtime/timeline.py` owns `ActionTimeline`: committing and sampling decoded
joint trajectories on the runtime clock. Keep chunk handoff here and in the
strategy. Do not fake measured state or modify observations to implement another
algorithm's overlap/truncation behavior.

Read `manimux/runtime/executors/base.py`: an executor implements `reset(state)`,
`horizon_steps` and `step(now_ns, state, reference) -> RobotCommand`. It consumes
`ActionHorizon` and owns command generation/smoothing/configured limits, not model
requests or hardware sessions. Follow the actual executor construction in
`runtime/edge.py` when adding a type; do not assume the policy plugin loader applies.
Per-group gripper indices come from assembly layout, not a universal last-column
assumption. Reject unsupported behavior rather than silently choosing another mode.

For scheduling changes use a deterministic clock and synthetic chunks to check
timestamps, overlap, delayed/rejected responses and reset as relevant. For executor
changes check actual arm/tool limits and output groups. Preserve capability checks;
an algorithm setting alone does not implement the model's sampling hooks.

## Viewer, replay and recording

Read `manimux/viewer/robots/base.py` (`RobotAdapter`) and its sibling loader.
This is a display adapter, distinct from `policy_adapter.PolicyAdapter`.
Robot display implementations belong in `viewer/robots/`; generic UI consumes
their group definitions, pose/visual mappings and assets. The loader supports
`module:factory` and `manimux.viewer.robots` entry points.

Keep URDF display mapping distinct from command coordinates: rendering two fingers
does not add two action DOFs. Use offline models/assets for replay; loading an action
trajectory must not open a robot connection. Missing assets should be reported,
not substituted with invented geometry. Replay should not change live inference,
recording or session behavior. See `tests/unit/test_action_replay.py`.

Record runtime evidence under `manimux/recording/`. Distinguish predicted actions,
sent commands and measured motion; Viewer refresh rate is not control frequency.
Do not reintroduce teleoperation or demonstration collection as part of replay.

## Which YAML owns the setting?

The composition entry is an experiment under
`manimux/configs/experiments/<task>/<model>/`. Use `manimux.cli.load_config()` and
the existing referenced-config loading; do not create another schema/merge system.

- **Component YAML**, `configs/embodiment/{arm,end_effector,sensor}/`: implementation,
  component model options, action layout and reusable device defaults.
- **Robot assembly**, `configs/embodiment/robot/`: named components/groups, mounts
  and shared body hardware/control configuration. Shared control profiles own
  reusable motion limits; an experiment selects or explicitly overrides them.
- **Private station**, `configs/local/station.yaml` or selected `--local`: physical
  CAN/controller/device bindings and service addresses. Never assume enumeration
  order establishes left/right; do not commit installation-specific bindings.
- **Camera set**, `configs/embodiment/sensor/cameras/`: served source names and
  component selections, referenced by `camera_server.config`. Runtime `sensors`
  selects which sources to read; `policy.adapter.camera_map` maps them to model keys.
- **Deployment recipe**, `configs/policy/<model>/<embodiment>/<task>/`: checkpoint
  and serving/inference settings. `policy_server.config` selects this recipe;
  it does not own robot execution. Model defaults remain in XPolicyLab.
- **Experiment `policy`**: runtime client (`worker`, service/options), action
  interval/horizon/timeouts/delay and inline `adapter` class/mappings. There is no
  required separate YAML for every field. Do not hard-code experiment values such
  as `action_dt_s`, `horizon_policy_steps` or `inference_delay_s` into Python bases.
- **Inference YAML**, `configs/inference/`: algorithm request/chunk rules.
- **Executor YAML**, `configs/executor/`: smoothing and command-generation choices.
- **Experiment run/viewer/recording**: task, output, lifecycle/UI and rollout settings.
  Private training work stays in the ignored root `training/` workspace.

In the list above, `configs/` means `manimux/configs/`.
`policy` describes the runtime side; `policy_server` selects the model-serving side
of the same experiment. Pair their action representation, checkpoint identity and
sampler capabilities. Do not delete identity checks to make a mismatched pair start.

Keep `policy.action_dt_s` (model trajectory spacing), `robot.control_hz` (command
frequency), camera acquisition rate and recording video rate independent. Horizon,
decoded prefix and executed chunk length are also distinct. Do not infer one from
another just because one example happens to use the same value.

## Example and checks

Trace `configs/experiments/put_bottles/pi05/yam_pi05_joint.yaml` under `manimux/`:
robot assembly -> component YAMLs; camera set -> station bindings; policy server
recipe -> client format and joint adapter; RTC -> timeline; smooth executor ->
robot commands. Copy only the relevant choices when adding an experiment.

Load the changed YAML through the real loader and inspect its resolved values
without constructing devices or starting services. Check reference paths relative
to their containing file, client/adapter pairing and declared group layout. For
actual usage/commands follow `.agents/skills/manimux-experiment/SKILL.md`, which
owns the existing startup workflow. Do not treat config loading as SDK, model or
hardware validation.
